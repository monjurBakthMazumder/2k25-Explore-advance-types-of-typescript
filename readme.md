#  2k25: Explore Advanced Types of TypeScript

This guide offers a comprehensive overview of essential and advanced TypeScript concepts. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your skills, this documentation walks you through key topics—from basic setup to powerful type manipulation techniques including generics, conditional types, and utility types.

---

## 🛠 TypeScript Project Setup

### 1. Initialize TypeScript

```bash
tsc --init
```

### 2. Update `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src/",
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Install `ts-node-dev`

```bash
npm install -g ts-node-dev
```

### 4. Run the project

```bash
ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts
```

## Advanced Types

Take your TypeScript skills to the next level with advanced type techniques:

1. **Type Assertion & Type Narrowing**
   Guide TypeScript when it's unsure about a variable’s type. Use type assertions and refine types for safety and accuracy.

2. **Interfaces: `type` vs `interface`**
   Understand the difference and best use cases for `type` aliases and `interface` structures.

3. **Introduction to Generics**
   Create reusable code components that work across different types with TypeScript generics.

4. **Generics with Interfaces**
   Use generics inside interfaces to make strongly typed, reusable components and APIs.

5. **Functions with Generics**
   Write flexible, type-safe functions that can accept multiple types with ease.

6. **Constraints in Generics**
   Limit which types a generic can accept, ensuring more predictable and robust code.

7. **Constraints Using `keyof`**
   Leverage `keyof` to restrict generics to known object properties.

8. **Asynchronous TypeScript**
   Use TypeScript's type system to safely handle asynchronous code and promises.

9. **Conditional Types**
   Build dynamic types that adapt based on input conditions.

10. **Mapped Types**
    Transform existing types into new ones by iterating over keys with mapped types.

11. **Utility Types**
    Simplify code with TypeScript’s built-in utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, `Record`, `Required`, and more.
